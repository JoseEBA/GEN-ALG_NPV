This is the repository of the project: Application of Genetic Algorithm to Maximize the Net Present Value of Various Cash Flows: for a Case Study.

# Objective
To propose a configuration of the genetic algorithm evaluating the best computational performance concerning the initial population and number of generations in a case study to maximize the net present value of an investment.

# Abstract
The genetic algorithm (GA) is an evolutionary algorithm used to solve search and optimization problems. In the present work, a GA configuration is proposed, evaluating the best computational performance concerning the initial population and number of generations in a case study to maximize an investmentâ€™s net present value (NPV). The proposed method maximizes the NPV using AG to make an investment decision in a case study. The GA results are evaluated with a statistical test having viable solutions between parameters used, initial population, and the number of generations, the proposed method has good efficiency of 99.90% and computational time of 1.29 seconds compared to the literature results. The best performance was for the parameters: parental selection by roulette, reproduction by one-point crossover, gene-by-gene mutation, selection of the next generation without elitism, the initial population of 5 individuals, and stopping criterion of 40 generations. The results obtained by the proposed AG show an acceptable solution for the case study.
